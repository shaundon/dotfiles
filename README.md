# Shaun's dotfiles

## About

The famous [dotfiles](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles) with a load
of stuff changed for my personal purposes.

A non-exhaustive list of what this installs:
* Homebrew plus a few packages.
* Lots of apps through MAS and Cask.
* NVM.
* Various macOS settings.
* Some cool aliases and bash functions.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shaundon/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && source bootstrap.sh
```
