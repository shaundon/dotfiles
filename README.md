The stuff I do when I get a new Mac.

## Getting started

Download this repo then run `setup.sh`

## Go further

This repo does **not** do the following, which you probably want on a new computer:

* Install [Xcodes](https://www.xcodes.app)
* Install [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). If you do install NVM, add the contents of `nvm-hook` in this repo to your `.zshrc` for convenience.
* VSCode plugins
